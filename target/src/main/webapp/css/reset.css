/* So
 
what
 
changed
 
from
 
the
 
last
 
iteration
?



I
 
added
 
background
:
 
transparent
;
 
to
 
the
 
first
 
rule
.
  
It’s
 
probably
 
not
 
as
 
necessary
 
as
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
other
 
bits
 
here
,
but
 
it
 
seemed
 
like
 
a
 
good
 
thing
 
to
 
add
.



Added
 
a
 
:focus
 
rule
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
suppress
 
link
 
outlining
.
  
Why
?
  
So
 
that
 
you
 
remember
 
to
 
define
 
your
 
own
.
  
You
 
should
 
make
 
sure
 
to
 
define
 
an
 
outline
,
as
 
it’s
 
an
 
important
 
accessibility
 
aid
.
  
If
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
universal
 
default
,
one
 
that
 
applies
 
no
 
matter
 
what
 
the
 
project
,
then
 
replace
 
my
 
rule
 
with
 
your
 
own
.



There’s
 
now
 
a
 
body
 
rule
 
that
 
sets
 
a
 
baseline
 
line-height
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
inherited
 
by
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
document
 
(
and
 
can
 
be
 
overridden
 
easily
)
,
and
 
sets
 
a
 
foreground
 
and
 
background
 
color
.
  
Originally
,
I
 
avoided
 
setting
 
the
 
colors
,
but
 
decided
 
it
 
was
 
better
 
to
 
put
 
them
 
in
.
  
Of
 
course
,
if
 
you
 
have
 
preferred
 
color
 
defaults
 
other
 
than
 
black
 
on
 
white
,
edit
 
the
 
declarations
 
to
 
suit
 
your
 
taste
.



The
 
a
 
img
,
:link
 
img
,
:visited
 
img
 
rule
 
has
 
been
 
dropped
.
  
This
 
is
 
because
 
the
 
only
 
browser
 
family
 
it
 
really
 
affects
 
is
 
Gecko
 
line
,
and
 
they
 
all
 
honor
 
author
 
styles
 
as
 
having
 
precedent
 
over
 
user
 
agent
 
styles
 
(
as
 
they
 
should
!).
  
So
 
this
 
is
 
already
 
covered
 
by
 
the
 
first
 
rule
.



Added
 
a
 
rule
 
for
 
caption
,
th
,
td
 
to
 
be
 
left-aligned
 
and
 
normal-weight
.



Added
 
a
 
blockquote
,
q
 
rule
 
to
 
suppress
 
quotes
 
by
 
way
 
of
 
the
 
quotes
 
property
.
  
This
 
has
 
the
 
same
 
intent
 
as
 
the
 
previous
 
rule
,
but
 
approaches
 
it
 
along
 
a
 
different
 
route
.



I
 
also
 
asked
 
for
 
help
 
in
 
figuring
 
out
 
how
 
to
 
simulate
 
inherit
 
in
 
IE
/Win.
  
In
 
the
 
end
,
it
 
seems
 
to
 
me
 
like
 
doing
 
so
 
isn’t
 
really
 
necessary
 
for
 
most
 
people
.
  
As
 
I
 
said
 
before
:



[
The
inherit
]
 
effects
,
as
 
seen
 
in
 
my
 
development
 
environment
,
will
 
still
 
serve
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
reminding
 
me
 
to
 
build
 
up
 
the
 
styles
 
I
 
actually
 
want
,
and
 
not
 
use
 
the
 
browsers’
 
defaults
 
as
 
a
 
crutch
.
 
There
 
is
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
my
 
forgetting
 
that
 
(
for
 
example
)
 
IE
/Win
 
italicizes
 
em
 
when
 
I
 
don’t
 
want
 
it
 
to
,
but
 
that’s
 
something
 
I’ll
 
catch
 
during
 
the
 
browser
 
testing
 
phase
.


So
 
that
 
works
 
for
 
me
,
and
 
I
 
think
 
for
 
most
 
people
 
who
 
have
 
outlooks
 
similar
 
to
 
mine
.
  
But
 
maybe
 
you
 
develop
 
primarily
 
in
 
IE
/Win
,
or
 
you
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
IE
/Win
 
handle
 
as
 
many
 
of
 
these
 
resets
 
as
 
humanly
 
possible
.
  
In
 
that
 
case
,
you
 
have
 
two
 
basic
 
choices
.



Use
 
the
 
script
 
and
 
syntax
 
contributed
 
by
 
Jonathan
 
Snook
 
and
 
Dean
 
Edwards
.
  
Note
,
however
,
that
 
Dean
 
himself
 
doesn’t
 
recommend
 
doing
 
this
,
feeling
 
that
 
it’s
 
too
 
computationally
 
expensive
 
for
 
such
 
a
 
small
 
effect
.
  
Dean
 
has
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
experience
 
with
 
scripting
 
around
 
IE
/Win’s
 
limitations
,
so
 
I
 
give
 
his
 
views
 
on
 
this
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
weight
.
  
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand
,
I’d
 
like
 
to
 
see
 
IE
/Win
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
honor
 
inherit
,
or
 
at
 
least
 
get
 
the
 
same
 
behavior
,
so
 
I
 
might
 
still
 
use
 
the
 
script
.
  
(
Though
 
I’d
 
be
 
even
 
happier
 
with
 
a
 
script
 
that
 
just
 
tacked
 
itself
 
onto
 
instance
 
of
 
inherit
 
in
 
a
 
style
 
sheet
,
like
 
Dean’s
 
IE7
 
script
 
does
 
for
 
other
 
CSS
 
stuff
.)



Put
 
in
 
your
 
own
 
expressions
,
along
 
the
 
lines
 
suggested
 
by
 
Priit
 
and
 
thacker
.
  
It’s
 
not
 
quite
 
the
 
same
 
thing
,
but
 
it’s
 
a
 
pretty
 
decent
 
approximation
.



Like
 
I
 
say
,
these
 
aren’t
 
necessary
 
unless
 
you’re
 
really
 
sold
 
on
 
the
 
idea
 
of
 
IE
/Win
 
being
 
forced
 
into
 
line
 
with
 
everyone
 
else
 
and
 
don’t
 
mind
 
paying
 
the
 
computational
 
overhead
.
  
If
 
so
,
then
 
you
 
can
 
extend
 
your
 
own
 
reset
 
styles
 
as
 
needed
.



That’s
 
much
 
of
 
the
 
point
 
here
:
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
case
 
of
 
“everyone
 
must
 
use
 
these
 
styles
 
in
 
a
 
certain
 
way
 
without
 
alteration”
.
  
Nor
 
am
 
I
 
saying
 
that
 
everyone
 
must
 
use
 
them
 
or
 
else
 
be
 
cast
 
into
 
darkness
.
  
Remember
 
before
 
that
 
I
 
termed
 
these
 
“my
 
take
 
on
 
the
 
topic
 
of
 
reset
 
styles”
 
(
emphasis
 
added
).
  
Your
 
take
 
may
 
be
 
subtly
 
or
 
greatly
 
different
.
  
Think
 
of
 
these
 
as
 
a
 
starting
 
point
 
for
 
creating
 
your
 
own
 
defaults
,
in
 
addition
 
to
 
being
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
illuminate
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
browser
 
defaults
.
  
Simply
 
the
 
act
 
of
 
taking
 
those
 
defaults
 
into
 
consideration
 
and
 
thinking
 
about
 
them
 
closely
 
puts
 
you
 
ahead
 
of
 
99%
of
 
your
 
peers
.
  
I
 
do
 
think
 
that
 
reset
 
styles
 
are
 
quite
 
useful
;
 
otherwise
,
I
 
wouldn’t
 
have
 
written
 
about
 
them
 
here
,
and
 
certainly
 
not
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
that
 
I
 
have
.
  
My
 
hope
 
is
 
that
 
people
 
will
 
use
 
them
 
as
 
a
 
launch
 
pad
 
for
 
their
 
own
 
resets
 
and
 
for
 
deeper
 
thinking
 
about
 
styling
 
and
 
browsers
.



My
 
thanks
 
to
 
everyone
 
who
 
commented
,
not
 
just
 
those
 
I
 
linked
 
above
.
  
And
 
yes
,
I’m
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
that
 
“weirdness
 
of
 
form
 
elements”
 
post
 
in
 
the
 
near
 
future
.



Addendum
 
2
May
 
07
:
 
I
 
edited
 
the
 
CSS
 
to
 
change
 
background
:
 
transparent
 
to
 
background-image
:
 
transparent
,
as
 
it
 
was
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
from
 
the
 
outset
 
but
 
I
 
somehow
 
didn’t
 
see
 
in
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
three
 
times
 
I
 
looked
 
over
 
the
 
declarations
.
  
So
 
I
 
guess
 
that
 
makes
 
this
 
post
 
now
 
“final
.0
.1″
.



Addendum
 
4
May
 
07
:
 
background-image
:
 
transparent
?
  
There’s
 
a
 
big
 
ol’
 
WTF
.
  
Apparently
 
my
 
cold
 
medication
 
has
 
warped
 
me
 
a
 
lot
 
more
 
than
 
I
 
believed
.
  
I’ve
 
taken
 
out
 
that
 
whole
 
declaration
 
and
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
editing
 
the
 
styles
 
any
 
further
 
until
 
I’m
 
off
 
the
 
meds
.
  
So
,
not
 
quite
 
final
,
apparently
